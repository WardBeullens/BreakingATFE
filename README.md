# BreakingATFE

Implementations accompanying the "Graph-theorethic Algorithms for the Alternating Trilinear Form Isomorphism problem" paper. (Soon to be on ePrint)

To run the O(q) algorithm for $n=9$ (on a random pair of isomorphic forms input) do 

```
make test
./test
```

The Sage code to reproduce Table 2 is in the SAGE/ folder (requires SAGE 9.5 or newer).
